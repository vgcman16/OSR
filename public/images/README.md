# Public Images Directory

This directory stores static image assets that can be referenced directly by the UI.

## Folder Structure

- `vehicles/`
  - Contains vehicle-related imagery for transportation UI elements.
  - Expected filenames:
    - `car.svg` – generic sedan silhouette suitable for default vehicle artwork.
    - `truck.svg` – box truck outline for logistics visuals.
- `tools/`
  - Contains tool-related imagery for equipment UI elements.
  - Expected filenames:
    - `wrench.svg` – adjustable wrench icon for maintenance tooling.
    - `hammer.svg` – claw hammer icon for construction references.

Additional assets should follow the same naming convention and reside in the appropriate subfolder.
